The 1908 Massasoit describes the team as \u201cthe greatest since the days of Alonzo Stagg\u2019s wonderful eleven.\u201d Springfield College was considered \u201ceasy pickings\u201d for Harvard, but \u201cthe clever handling of the forward pass completely demoralized the Harvard team.\u201d The first half ended with no score. Early in the second half, Springfield twice broke through Harvard\u2019s line and blocked Burr\u2019s punts, the second being secured by Colton for a touchdown. Harvard soon scored after a series of fierce line plunges, and the score was tied. A goal by Burr in the last few minutes won the game for Harvard. According to the 1908 Massasoit, \u201cthe victory brought no glory with it, the laurels resting with Springfield who outplayed their heavier rivals at all stages of the game.\u201d The score was 9-5. The members of the football team were J. Wheeler Bailey, Chester E. Briggs, Herbert P. Colton, Harry A. Cook, George A. Crispin, Hermann T. Hemmen, Fred L. Honhart, William N. Howard, Thomas E. Jones, J. Howard McCullock, Harry O. McGuire, and Pearl B. Rice. The coach was Russel S. Flower, and the manager was J. H.

The 1908 Massasoit describes the team as \u201cthe greatest since the days of Alonzo Stagg\u2019s wonderful eleven.\u201d Springfield College was considered \u201ceasy pickings\u201d for Harvard, but \u201cthe clever handling of the forward pass completely demoralized the Harvard team.\u201d The first half ended with no score. Early in the second half, Springfield twice broke through Harvard\u2019s line and blocked Burr\u2019s punts, the second being secured by Colton for a touchdown. Harvard soon scored after a series of fierce line plunges, and the score was tied. A goal by Burr in the last few minutes won the game for Harvard. According to the 1908 Massasoit, \u201cthe victory brought no glory with it, the laurels resting with Springfield who outplayed their heavier rivals at all stages of the game.\u201d The score was 9-5.

McCurdy, Faculty member and football coach at Springfield College, standing with athlete and Olympic star Jim Thorpe on Pratt Field at Springfield College. Thorpe is wearing a football uniform and McCurdy is holding a hat at his side. This photograph was likely taken around November 23, 1912, when the International YMCA College (now known as Springfield College) played against the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. The game captivated the local residents, drawing a crowd of seven thousand people to Pratt Field. Ultimately, Springfield lost 30-24. Jim Thorpe scored all the points for the Carlisle Indians. Jacobus Franciscus \"Jim\" Thorpe (May 28, 1888 \u2013 March 28, 1953) was an American athlete who played football for the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, he won Olympic gold medals for the 1912 pentathlon and decathlon, played football (collegiate and professional), and also played professional baseball and basketball. Thorpe retired from athletic competition at the age of 41. James Huff McCurdy graduated from Springfield College in 1890. Dr. James H. McCurdy returned to Springfield in 1895 as a faculty member. He contributed to the field of physical education in many ways, including his studies on the relationship between heart rate, blood pressure, and motor tasks in adolescent boys. In 1924, he published one of the first texts for Exercise Physiology. He also coached football for 19 seasons, compiling a record of 68 wins, 42 losses and 14 ties.","Text on back reads, \"At (?)

McCurdy and Jim Thorpe (November 23, 1912),\" is mounted on cardboard and shows James H. McCurdy, Faculty member and football coach at Springfield College, standing with athlete and Olympic star Jim Thorpe on Pratt Field at Springfield College. Thorpe is wearing a football uniform and McCurdy is holding a hat at his side. This photograph was likely taken around November 23, 1912, when the International YMCA College (now known as Springfield College) played against the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. The game captivated the local residents, drawing a crowd of seven thousand people to Pratt Field. Ultimately, Springfield lost 30-24. Jim Thorpe scored all the points for the Carlisle Indians. Jacobus Franciscus \"Jim\" Thorpe (May 28, 1888 \u2013 March 28, 1953) was an American athlete who played football for the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, he won Olympic gold medals for the 1912 pentathlon and decathlon, played football (collegiate and professional), and also played professional baseball and basketball. Thorpe retired from athletic competition at the age of 41. James Huff McCurdy graduated from Springfield College in 1890. Dr. James H. McCurdy returned to Springfield in 1895 as a faculty member. He contributed to the field of physical education in many ways, including his studies on the relationship between heart rate, blood pressure, and motor tasks in adolescent boys. In 1924, he published one of the first texts for Exercise Physiology. He also coached football for 19 seasons, compiling a record of 68 wins, 42 losses and 14 ties.","mods:location":[{"mods:physicalLocation":"Springfield College Archives and Special Collections"},{"mods:url":[{"usage":"primary","#text":"http://cdm16122.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15370coll2/id/3052","access":"object in context"},{"#text":"http://ark.digitalcommonwealth.org/ark:/50959/0k225c632/thumbnail","access":"preview"}]}],"version":"3.5","mods:note":"Text on back reads, \"At (?)

Dr. James Huff McCurdy contributed to the field of physical education in many ways, including his studies on the relationship between heart rate, blood pressure, and motor tasks in adolescent boys. In 1924, he published one of the first texts for Exercise Physiology. In 1918, James H. McCurdy realized the need \u201cfor an extensive programme of sports and recreation in the immediate postwar period that would bridge the gap and ease the transition between military service and civilian life.\u201d The result was the Inter-Allied Games, the biggest international sports event that had ever been held at that time. Attended by 25,000 people, the Games were a huge success. Dr. McCurdy was the Director of the Division of Athletes, Hygiene and Health for the American YMCA among American troops in France. The 1909 record was 5-1.","Slide is cracked and chipped; this image was first published in the 1910 Massasoit (p 143)."],"@id":"http://dp.la/api/items/6f38eb1ef6a92a4b9ca2a3f5e2dc1031#sourceResource","language":[{"iso639_3":"eng","name":"English"}],"identifier":["Local other: LS_09_62"]},"@id":"http://dp.la/api/items/6f38eb1ef6a92a4b9ca2a3f5e2dc1031","ingestType":"item","originalRecord":{"id":"oai:digitalcommonwealth.org:commonwealth-oai:73666529x","provider":{"@id":"http://dp.la/api/contributor/digital-commonwealth","name":"Digital Commonwealth"},"collection":{"id":"04cf0dc7f4e3df051e39811cac44ea6e","description":"","title":"College Archives Digital Collections","@id":"http://dp.la/api/collections/04cf0dc7f4e3df051e39811cac44ea6e"},"header":{"identifier":"oai:digitalcommonwealth.org:commonwealth-oai:73666529x","setSpec":"commonwealth-oai:r207tt62z","datestamp":"2015-09-03T17:27:42Z"},"metadata":{"mods:mods":{"mods:name":{"mods:role":{"mods:roleTerm":{"authority":"marcrelator","#text":"Creator","authorityURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators","type":"text","valueURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre"}},"mods:namePart":"W.

Members of the team are [back row, L to R] Isaiah H. Farnham (team manager; class of 1910), James Huff McCurdy (professor and team coach; class of 1890), Walter A. Smethurst (team assistant manager) (class of 1912), [2nd row, L to R] Ernest F. Moller (class of 1910), William S. Yeager (class of 1910), Ferdinand J. Courleux (class of 1911), Seymour W.

Hopkins (class of 1910). The emblem on the team sweaters was as the official school emblem until 1912, when the school became the International YMCA College. Dr. James Huff McCurdy contributed to the field of physical education in many ways, including his studies on the relationship between heart rate, blood pressure, and motor tasks in adolescent boys. In 1924, he published one of the first texts for Exercise Physiology. In 1918, James H. McCurdy realized the need \u201cfor an extensive programme of sports and recreation in the immediate postwar period that would bridge the gap and ease the transition between military service and civilian life.\u201d The result was the Inter-Allied Games, the biggest international sports event that had ever been held at that time. Attended by 25,000 people, the Games were a huge success. Dr. McCurdy was the Director of the Division of Athletes, Hygiene and Health for the American YMCA among American troops in France.
